## Time committment

You can spend as much time as you want on the exercise, but you are absolutely free to put a time limit (we recommend 3 hours) and tell us about it. We respect the fact that you might have other hiring processes and that you don't have a lot of time.

## Deliverable

Please make sure you include the following items:

- `[README.md](http://README.md)`
    - General approach
    - Technical choices
    - How did you evaluate the solution?
    - How much time did you spend on the exercise?
    - Remaining todos
    - ... and any other item you think should appear in a README.

The code, its comments and the README should all be in English. Don't forget to proofread yourself (tip: feel free to use Grammarly)!

## Functional specifications

The aim of this assessment is to challenge you on a technical basis, involving machine learning, programming and research skills.

‚û°Ô∏è  ‚û°Ô∏è Goal

You goal is to develop an algorithm that detect the language of an arbitrary text (sentences or more lengthy texts). For example, your algorithm should return ‚Äúen‚Äù for the English sentence ‚ÄúI am currently eating my breakfast‚Äù, or ‚Äúfr‚Äù for the French sentence ‚ÄúJ‚Äôai oubli√© mon parapluie dans l‚Äôabribus‚Äù.

‚û°Ô∏è  ‚û°Ô∏è How?

In order to carry out this assessment, we provide a dataset containing sentences in 21 languages (named ‚Äúformatted_data‚Äù). This database is a .csv files whose separator is a ‚Äú;‚Äù. The first column is the language code, the second one is the text, and the third one is the number of characters in the specified language.
This database is a collection of texts extracted from the European Union Proceedings.
A research article is provided to give you some insights on how to design such algorithm. We strongly advise you to use it in order to finish the assignment on time.
You are not required to use all languages to train your model and you can use any available resource to solve the problem (apart from directly using a pre-packaged language detector‚Ä¶).

## Technical specifications

- We can read most programming languages. Just so you know, we mostly use Python and Augular/TypeScript at Upskills. Justify the language you chose in your README.
- You can use any library or framework. Justify all your important choices in your README.
- You can challenge *anything* that we've currently implemented.

## How we review

The most important thing is that **you should feel proud of your work**. If you don't have time to finish, it is better to polish what you've already done than start something and risk not doing it well. You can always include a list of remaining todos in the README - we will take it into account when we review. Focus on the things that let your skills shine!

We will have a look at the following aspects:

- Correctness: does your solution work?
- Performance: what is the quality of your solution? How fast is the process?
- Maintainability: does your code include the necessary best practices to make it easy for a team to build on top of it? Have you fixed most of the issues with our implementation?
- Code style: how easy is it to read and comprehend your code? Are you following the language's code style (e.g. PEP8 for Python)?

Those aspects are **critical** to us:

- Writing skills: make sure to proofread yourself and remove all typos, orthographical mistakes, etc.
- Important technical tradeoffs need to be justified.

## Our tips

If you're using Python:

- Consider using poetry to handle dependencies
- Consider using a linter (e.g. flake8) and an autoformatter (e.g. black)
