##  ⚠️   Notes for candidates

You should have received our instructions laying out what's expected from you and how we will review it.

This is a fake repository and not a real production application that we use. We included a lot of wrong practices and misconfigurations on purpose. **Do no use this as a source of inspiration for your project!**

The rest of this README will be written as if it was a real application.
